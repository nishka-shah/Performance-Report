# Performance-Report
PowerBI Performance Report Dashboard - Plant Co. Performance Report

Used mock Excel dataset to create a dynamic PowerBI dashboard.
Includes use of SWITCH measures, conditional formatting, and dynamic titles. 
Filter using year, and the following measures: Gross Profit, Quantity, Sales
4 charts to compare measures as well as YTD (year to date) and PYTD (prior year to date) sales

Example Analysis:
- Zoom slider feature on scatter plot allows to see which products have high GP% but low quantity as these products can be targetted by Sales team.
- Sales team should review what was being done in February as it had the greatest GP in 2024. February 2023 had much lower GP, so should focus on what changes were made to attribute to the higher GP.
